# ytlooper

## Purpose
Make it easier for musicians to learn songs using YouTube audio by providing an application to create 
custom time loops for different sections of a song. For each video a user can create loops that each have 
a start time, end time, and name. 

For instance, loops can be created for the chorus and verse of a song so that the user can simply play
a section indefinitely in order to learn it sufficiently and then move on to the next section. A loop
with a short runtime can also be created that lasts for less then the duration of a chord essentially
freezing the track so that the user can determine a note or chord.
